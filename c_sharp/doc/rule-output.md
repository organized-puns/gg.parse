an operation which returns an output.  The output is a node in a tree. There are three modes in which the output is produced.

* self: the output is the result of the operation itself

* children: the output is the collection of the operation's children (the operation's own output will be removed)

* none: the operation can succeed, but all its output and it's children will be removed.

children: 

>> – strongly suggests "pass through" or "forward to children"
:: – could evoke "scope" or "contents of"
=> – implies transformation or "results in"
-> – shows direction toward children
<> – suggests "container" or "aggregate"
() – implies grouping/collection
:> – directional, less common

> – simple directional indicator
& – sometimes used for "and all of" or "with"
% – less intuitive, but unused
! – used for negation in many languages, so might work for "apply to contents"
